Goal:
* Encapsulate the choice of the concrete class to be used in creating objects of a given type.

Practical example:
* Consider a banking system that needs to send messages to its customers. For example,
After a purchase with a credit card, an information message
About the purchase can be sent to the customer.
If this client to an individual, choose to receive the message through
Email or SMS. On the other hand, if for a legal entity, you can also receive a message via Java Message Service (JMS).
